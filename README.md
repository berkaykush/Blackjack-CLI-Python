CLI Blackjack game in Python.

The game only allows players to choose between Hit and Stand options.
<br>
The Insurance option is not available.
<br>
Additionally, the dealer will hit on a soft 17.
<br>

In the case where a player has blackjack but the dealer does not, the dealer will pay the player at a rate of 3 to 2.
<br>
If both the player and the dealer have a blackjack, it results in a tie, and the player's bet is returned.
